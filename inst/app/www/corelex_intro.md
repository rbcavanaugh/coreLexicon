This web-app is intended to facilitate fast and reliable scoring of Core Lexicon Analysis, 
a discourse assessment originally developed by Dalton & Richardson (2015) that measures the typicality of words used in semi-structured discourse tasks. CoreLex is a micro-linguistic measure which provides information about word retrieval and lexical access in connected speech samples. CoreLex checklists consist of lemmas that are scored as either present (1) or absent (0), which makes scoring very simple. Checklists have been developed for a variety of widely used discourse tasks (including picture description, picture sequence, story retell, procedures, and unfamiliar narrative production) using large samples of healthy control speakers (Dalton et al., 2020).

CoreLex has shown good sensitivity in differentiating between controls and individuals with aphasia (Dalton & Richardson, 2015; Fromm et al., 2017), between individuals with fluent and non-fluent aphasia (Kim et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2021), and between aphasia subtypes (Dalton & Richardson, 2015; Fromm et al., 2017). Studies have also demonstrated that CoreLex is related to standardized measures of aphasia (Kim et al., 2019, Kim et al., 2021), other discourse measures (Alyahya et al., 2021; Dalton & Richardson, 2019; Kim & Wright, 2020) and picture naming (Alyahya et al., 2021). Preliminary evidence also suggests that CoreLex might be sensitive to treatment-induced changes in some PWA (Dalton et al., 2020; Dede & Hoover, 2021).
