It is recommended that you administer more than one discourse task to obtain a larger speech sample.
However, the optimal combination of semi-spontaneous discourse tasks to best represent everyday language
use is not yet known and is a focus of future research.In the past, we have taken several different approaches.

For example, we selected one of each type of semi-spontaneous discourse task (i.e., picture description,
storytelling, and procedural discourse) because discourse samples are known to vary by genre and stimuli type
and to include varied sampling that might, in combination, better predict spontaneous speech.

For other studies or settings, we selected the tasks that had higher reliability (e.g., picture
sequence description, picture description). We caution against the use of a single discourse task for
detection, diagnosis, characterization of deficits, or treatment response tracking."
