### Summary of measure

Core Lexicon Analysis is a discourse assessment originally developed by Dalton & Richardson (2015) that measures the typicality of words used in a semi-structured discourse task. CoreLex checklists have been developed for a variety of widely used discourse tasks (including picture description, picture sequence, story retell, procedures, and unfamiliar narrative production) have been developed using large samples of healthy control speakers (Dalton et al., 2020). CoreLex is a micro-linguistic measure which provides information about word retrieval and lexical access in connected speech samples. CoreLex checklists consist of lemmas that are scored as either present (1) or absent (0), which makes scoring very simple.

CoreLex has shown good sensitivity in differentiating between controls and individuals with aphasia (Dalton & Richardson, 2015; Fromm et al., 2017), between individuals with fluent and non-fluent aphasia (Kim et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2021), and between aphasia subtypes (Dalton & Richardson, 2015; Fromm et al., 2017). Studies have also demonstrated that CoreLex is related to standardized measures of aphasia (Kim et al., 2019, Kim et al., 2021), other discourse measures (Alyahya et al., 2021; Dalton & Richardson, 2019; Kim & Wright, 2020) and picture naming (Alyahya et al., 2021). Preliminary evidence also suggests that corelex might be sensitive to treatment-induced changes in some PWA (Dalton et al., 2020; Dede & Hoover, 2021).

### Results

This test was completed by `r params$name` and scored on `r format(params$start_time, format="%B %d %Y %R %Z")`. These results are specific to the ***`r stringr::str_to_title(paste(unlist(strsplit(params$stim, split = "_")), collapse = " "))` stimulus.*** 

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
cat(params$results_text)
shiny::setProgress(0.25)

```

<!-- ### Summary Table -->

```{r, echo = F, eval = F}
# not currently used. 
kableExtra::kbl(params$summary_table,
                format = "latex",
                booktabs = TRUE,
                caption = "Summary of results from MCA") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
shiny::setProgress(0.5)

```


### Plots

```{r, echo=F, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, warning = F}
get_results_plot(dat = params$data, time = params$time, basesize = 10)
shiny::setProgress(0.8)

```

**About these plots:**

- *The figure shows two density plots that represent the distribution of the discourse variables. (A density plot is essentially a smoothed version of a histogram.)*

- *The orange plot is the density plot for persons with aphasia. The purple plot is the density plot for controls. (These plots closely correspond to the values in our publications [Richardson & Dalton, 2015, 2019; Dalton & Richardson, 2018; Dalton et al., 2020], but are updated several times a year with additional participants scored in Dr. Richardsonâ€™s lab.)*

- *The vertical dashed line represents the discourse variable score for your patient/participant.*

### Administration notes 

*If notes were entered prior to scoring, they will appear below*

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
cat(params$notes)
